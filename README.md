# Tractor without Hail

## Introduction

This script was implemeneted based on the model published in Nature Genetics Atkinson et al (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00766-y). In our tests we used teh RFMix 1, with the output converted to RFMix 2 model using the script RFMix1ToRFMix2.py.

This pipeline has, as new features: 

- The model is easily aplicable to a N-way admixed population. 

- The model uses Generalized linear mixed model (package GMMAT on R) to uses a kinship matrix and the whole data from imputed data

- The author of the methodology recomends to run the Local Ancestry using the original file, so imputed SNPs between two windows inherit the ancestry of the nearest window


### Aplicability to a N-way admixed population

Our script is easily aplicable to N parental because the use of the equation

![Equation](./Equations/CodeCogsEqn.png)

Which sum means summation the H_i represents the number haplotypes for the ancestry i (all ancestries except one), the D_j represents the dosage for the ancestry j (All ancestries) and the "... + b_wX_w" means the other covariates. 

To do this our model uses the files generated by step 1 from the original pipeline (https://github.com/eatkinson/Tractor/wiki/Step-1:-Recovering-tracts-(Optional)) except for bcftools annotate. 

### Generalized linear mixed model (package GMMAT on R) to uses a kinship matrix and the whole data from imputed data

Using the "Unkinked" files our pipeline creates a covariative file for each SNP and run SNP by SNP a glmm.wald (slow, we try address this using multiprocessing). We also create a GDS file based on the VCF provided by the user, but we make P copies (P = number of processors to be used) of this GDS file because this file accepts one access per time, so each processor will have theis own GDS file.

To be faster, we do not exclude the temporary files while run the regression, but the final file will be one with all tested SNPs (<outputPrefix>_AllWald.txt). We also provide a flag (-s) to allow the user change the model to select the interest covariatives (the script will not set  the variables from Tractor automatically, the user will need to put it)
  

## How to use

Our pipeline uses R with the libraries SeqArray and GMMAT installed, bcftools and python 3.

We recommend the use of kinship matrix (you can convert from PLINK or KING using the scripts present in this GitHub).

Example of command line:

```
python3.8 main.py -c Covar.txt -v /home/USER/TopMed/WithoutHWE/chr22.dose.unkinked_Covar_MAF.vcf.gz -n 3 -m /home/USER/TopMed/WithoutHWE/Tractor/RFMixV1_chr22_AllSets.Unkinked.msp.tsv -i ID -p DISEASE -f /home/USER/TopMed/WithoutHWE/Tractor/newModel/Teste/ -o Try3 -t 48 -k PLINK_LARGE.table
```

```
